The ARC Game  serves as an ARC Editor specifically engineered for importing tests from the ARC Dataset and generating new tests. Its principal aim is to simplify the test creation process and facilitate the importation of tests from the ARC Dataset. Developed using React, a JavaScript library, the ARC Game is structured around different components such as \texttt{App.js} and \texttt{Grid.js}, while CSS is employed for styling purposes. This architecture ensures a modular and efficient design, allowing for flexibility and scalability in managing tests within the ARC Game interface. 

The core file,  App.js, acts as the root of the project, orchestrating its functionality. The Grid.js component, on the other hand, is responsible for displaying the tests and is styled using a corresponding CSS file. The layout and design of the game are achieved through CSS, utilizing grid-based layouts to ensure a visually appealing interface.

Moreover, JavaScript loops and arrays play a crucial role in parsing and displaying JSON data imported into the game. These functionalities enhance the game's flexibility and enable dynamic interaction with the ARC Dataset. Overall, ARC Game serves as a user-friendly platform for both importing existing tests and creating new ones, leveraging React and CSS to deliver an intuitive and efficient user experience.
